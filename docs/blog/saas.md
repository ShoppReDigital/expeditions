# Suggestions for SAAS Companies

1. What is the monetizable value of the problem u are solving?

2. Who to take the investment from?
eg: Headspin is an automated testing company. When the co-founder was part of Google, he developed the idea and tested it. He already built the term sheet before meeting the investors. He got an investment from a VC firm. With this, he went to Sundar Pichai, who said Google would be ready to invest the same amount as the investment from the VC.

Who do you think they took the investment from?

Headspin took from Google and not other VC because google had 90% of the phone market. 

So,
a. choosing the right investor who can give the right leverage can is very important
b. have a term sheet beforehand and inform the investors about the options

3. Best way to sell SAAS:
 - Give a free trial for 30 days, but take commitment to make the payment after free trial. Do not offer to customers who are not willing to make some payment after the free trial
 - In the initial stages - a 1-page form - sign up for 30 days free trial - make them agree to make the payment after the 30 days free trial
 - You can even have it on simple google docs "I __ agree to give the payment of 2000usd after 1 month"
 - Try different pricing amounts for different customers to find the right pricing.
 - Do the rabbit, deer, and elephant categorization
Rabbits - Small startups
Deers - Medium enterprises
elephants - Large enterprises

> Try rabbits only for feedback - they won't give much revenue - do not concentrate much here
> Spend more time with deers - mid-sized who have raised series A or B - they will give the time and money
> Do not waste time with the elephants unless you have access to the top decision-makers in the company

4. Important to scale fast, fail and learn early

5. Channel Partnership - 
Get credible companies to vouch for you
 - Headspin went to Tech Mahindra, to sell their software as they were customer -->> figure the channel of introduction. Eg: if the CTO of a top company refers you, there is more credibility
 - eg: Headspin cut a deal with Voonik, if the CEO introduces/gives testimonial, the cost would be slashed

6. Intro Mail/Talk is very important

 - First intro mail should be short - Headspin used to have a blurb which used to change every week based on the changes and learnings
 - How do you bring credibility? Even though Headspin was a google funded started, they dint write it as a 1st line - as it sounds like the investment is needed for the credibility.
 - Credibility has to come from the best customers:  "A hotstar, Netflix, etc are trying our Beta version, would you want to try?"


7. Go for conferences - divide and conquer - each person talk to as many people and collect cards and reach out to them after a small conversation

8. Don't go for performance contracts - eg: if X result comes, pay Y amount
 - you have to be confident that the product gives some basic value add
 - sell at the cost price initially
 - if they further want to cut the cost, ask if they can use their server, their hardware, etc to slash the cost

9. Start Selling Early: - with the bare minimum requirements

10. Create XYZ funnel
X - approached
Y - how many responded
Z - how many converted

Reverse engineer how many leads to be acquired for the planned targeted conversion numbers.
