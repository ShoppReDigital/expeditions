## What are the Customer Pain Points we address?

On one side: Indian products (specifically clothing, jewellery, ethnic
handicrafts, Ayurvedic medicines, food items etc) outside India are: 
 - Expensive 
 - Limited in Variety and Quality

And on the other side, Indians (and others) residing outside India currently does
not have access to E-commerce companies in India as: 
 - Most of the websites do not provide international shipping. Those few websites which provide international shipment do it an exorbitant rate. 
 - Many websites currently do not allow the usage of International Credit/Debit cards.
